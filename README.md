# ESD.OS

My own programming language, kernel, bootloader, operating system, graphics library, and applications.

## ü¶ç Philosophy ü¶ç

OOGA BOOGA! ESD.OS is MONKE OS. No safetynet, no thinky-thinky, only CRASH! ü¶ß U divide by zero? SYSTEM GO BONK. U touch NULL? REBOOT TIME, MONKE. No error, only PAIN and FUNNY. If u want safe, go banana elsewhere üçå

Every keypress is DANGER. Every syscall is BIG MONKE GAMBLE. U mess up? U go back to jungle (reboot). Only giga-monke allowed, no baby chimp. U want learn OS? OOGA, prepare for BONK. U want run homework? HAHA, MONKE LAUGH AT U.

Remember: in ESD.OS, only handler is BIG RED BUTTON (RESET). Enjoy PAIN, monke style. OOGA BOOGA! ü¶çüçå

## Roadmap & Prototypes

Development proceeds in small, focused prototypes, each adding a fundamental feature needed for a fully functional kernel. Each prototype is self-contained and demonstrates a single step in the evolution of the OS:

### ESD.Kernel-0.0.1:
- **01-simple-boot:** Minimal bootloader and kernel entry.
- **02-improved-console:** Basic console output improvements.
- **03-minimalist-syscalls:** Introduce a minimal system call interface for user programs to interact with the kernel (e.g., print to screen, exit). No error handling‚Äîmisuse leads to a crash or reboot.

Future prototypes will continue to add essential features, one at a time, always without error handlers or safety nets.

## Warning

This OS is for educational and experimental purposes only. It is intentionally unsafe and should not be used for any critical tasks.
